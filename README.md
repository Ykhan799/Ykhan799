### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Yaseen. I am currently a Software Engineer at Raytheon. 

Computer Science, Mathematics, Economics, History, and more. I love learning many subjects. In Computer Science, I am interested in Software Engineering and Data Science but I am exploring other fields like App Development. I enjoy creating and making each of my ideas functional. In the meantime, explore my repository to view my projects.

Additionally, feel free to reach out via [Linkedln](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaseenkkhan/) or [email](yaseenkkhan@yahoo.com) or view my [portfolio](https://ykhan799.github.io/)
