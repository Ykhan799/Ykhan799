### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Yaseen and I am a 4th year Computer Science major at UC Irvine. I transferred from Saddleback/Irvine Valley College.
**Pronouns:** he/him/his  


Computer Science, Mathematics, Economics, History, and more. I love learning many subjects. In Computer Science, I am interested in Software Engineering and Data Science but I am exploring other fields like App Development. I enjoy creating and making each of my ideas functional. In the meantime, explore my repository to view my projects. I am currently looking for full-time Software Engineer or Data Science positions
