### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Yaseen and I am a 3rd year Computer Science major at UC Irvine. I recently transferred from Saddleback/Irvine Valley College.
**Pronouns:** he/him/his  


Computer Science, Mathematics, Economics, History, and more. I love learning many subjects. In Computer Science, I am interested in Software Engineering and Data Science but I am exploring other fields like App Development. I enjoy creating and making each of my ideas functional. I am currently looking for an internship for Summer 2022.
